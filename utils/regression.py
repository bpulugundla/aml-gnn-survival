):
    """
    Fit a simple linear regression that maps risk scores from the GNN model
    to log-transformed survival times (days_to_death).

    This function:
    - Runs the model in evaluation mode on the training data.
    - Extracts risk scores for patients labeled as Dead (label == 0)
      who have non-missing days_to_death.
    - Applies a log1p transform to days_to_death to stabilize variance
      and reduce the impact of outliers.
    - Fits a scikit-learn LinearRegression mapping risk -> log1p(days_to_death).

    Args:
        model (torch.nn.Module): Trained graph model that outputs risk scores.
        train_loader (DataLoader): PyTorch DataLoader over the training set.
        edge_index_genes (torch.Tensor): Gene-gene edge index.
        edge_index_patients (torch.Tensor): Patient-patient edge index.
        num_clinical (int): Number of clinical features to split from batch_x.
        device (str): Device for inference.

    Returns:
        sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression:
            Fitted linear regressor for predicting log-days-to-death from risk scores.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If no uncensored Dead patients are found in the training set.

    Notes:
        - The survival signal is only learned for Dead patients, since Alive patients
          are right-censored (unknown days_to_death).
        - Assumes risk scores are monotonically correlated with hazard â€” higher risk,
          lower expected survival. If this assumption fails, linear regression is inappropriate.
        - The log1p transform is inverted with expm1 during prediction.
